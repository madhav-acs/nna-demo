DIAGNOSIS
During the diagnosis and repair, follow the procedures listed below. For more detail about any of these procedures, see the applicable service information.
Wheel Removal and Installation
Engine Undercover Removal and Installation
Drive Belt Removal and Installation
Crankshaft Pulley Removal and Installation
Timing Belt Removal and Installation
Side Engine Mount Removal and Installation
Timing Belt Auto-Tensioner Removal and Installation

DIAGNOSIS
1. Start the engine, let it warm up, and listen for a chirp.
It can take up to 30 minutes for the engine to become hot enough to hear a chirp.
Do you hear a chirp?
If you hear a chirp coming from the timing belt area, go to step 2.
If you hear a chirp coming from the high pressure fuel pump, refer to service bulletin 16-008, High Pressure 
Fuel Pump Chirps (except RDX).
If you do not hear a chirp, this bulletin does not apply. Continue with normal troubleshooting procedures

DIAGNOSIS
2. Remove the drive belt and retest the engine while it is hot.
If you hear a chirp, go to step 3.
If you do not hear a chirp, this bulletin does not apply. Continue with normal troubleshooting procedures.
3. RLX Sport Hybrid only: Disconnect the high-voltage cable to the electric A/C compressor (the compressor is not 
removed). Refer to the electric A/C compressor removal procedure in the service information (steps 2, 3, and 8).
NOTE: Because there is limited space between the timing belt covers and the shock tower, remove the front strut 
brace and lift the engine about 35 mm to remove the timing belt covers

DIAGNOSIS
4. RLX Sport Hybrid only: Remove the timing belt covers. Refer to the timing belt removal procedure in the service 
information (steps 1–4 and 7–17)
5. RLX Sport Hybrid only: Install/connect the following components: exhaust pipe A, the lower half of the side engine 
mount bracket, the high-voltage cable to the electric A/C compressor, and the oil filter base/oil cooler/oil filter 
assembly. Then, install the service plug and connect the 12-volt battery terminal. Go to step 17.
6. Remove the right front wheel.
7. Remove the engine undercover
8. Hold the crankshaft pulley with the holder handle and the pulley holder
9. Remove the crankshaft bolt with a heavy duty 19 mm socket and a breaker bar, then remove the crankshaft pulley 
and washer. Temporarily reinstall the crankshaft bolt.
10. If equipped, remove the injector control module and move to the side
11. RDX only: Remove the upper fender trim and the coolant tank.
12. RDX only: Remove the PCM bracket (no connectors unplugged).
13. Remove the front and rear upper covers. Keep the A/C pressure sensor harness out of the way of moving parts by attaching it to the A/C line with a zip tie.
14. Install the injector control module

DIAGNOSIS
15. RDX only: Remove the side engine mount. The side engine mount is removed to gain access to the lower timing belt cover.
16. Remove the lower cover. 
17. Start the engine while it is still hot, then spray the back edge of the timing belt with water while it is running. 
On RLX Sport Hybrid models there are more disassembly steps that could allow the engine to cool, you may have 
to warm up the engine before squirting the timing belt with water to see if the chirp lessens.
Do you still hear a chirp?
If the chirp lessens, changes pitch, or goes away, go to REPAIR PROCEDURE
If the chirp does not change, this bulletin does not apply. Continue with normal troubleshooting procedures.
