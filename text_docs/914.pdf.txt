QX60 CVT Warranty extension
INFINITI CAMPAIGN BULLETIN CVT WARRANTY extension
Date: August 30, 2022
Attention: Retailer Principal, Sales, Parts and Service Managers
UPDATE August 30, 2022 Please discard earlier versions of this bulletin.
The announcement from June 2, 2022 has been revised to include:
1. The voucher program ID numbers provided in the FAQ section of this retailer announcement have
been changed. The new voucher program ID numbers are:
    INFINITI program ID: 22I2299CVT
    Nissan program ID: 22N2299CVT

In an effort to assure client satisfaction, demonstrate our confidence in continuously variable
transmissions (CVTs), and to address client concerns including those expressed by clients in the class
actions, INFINITI will extend the warranty coverage on the CVT. The warranty extension includes the
CVT assembly and internal CVT components, gaskets, and seals, CVT control valve body, torque
converter, cooler kit (if applicable) and reprogramming of the Transmission Control Module (TCM), on
the vehicle listed in this announcement. The warranty is being extended from its original duration of
72 months/70,000 miles to 96 months/94,000 miles (whichever occurs first).
Coverage of other vehicle components remains unchanged, and all other terms, conditions, limitations
and exclusions of INFINITIâ€™s New Vehicle Limited Warranty continue to apply.

***** What Retailers Should Do *****
1. If an owner contacts a retailer with a CVT concern in an owned or leased vehicle, verify
warranty coverage for the specific VIN and then inform the client of any diagnostic charges.
NOTE: Some owners may have opted out of the warranty extension by excluding themselves
from the class action settlement, thus it is important to check the VIN for each vehicle to
verify coverage.

2. Use the appropriate Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) and/or Electronic Service Manual (ESM)
to diagnose the root cause of the client concern and identify the correct repair to resolve the
client concerns.
NOTE: Dealers will need to follow the warranty process and obtain pre-approval using the
VCAT tool. Please reference IWBI/21-002.

3. CVT warranty coverage can be confirmed using the warranty extensions/customer service
initiatives page in Service Comm or DBS National Service History.
4. If the vehicle is no longer covered by a powertrain or parts warranty, provide owners a repair
estimate for a test drive, diagnosis, and repair. If an owner requests assistance, be sure to
consult goodwill guidelines available in the Assurance Products Resources Manual (APRM)
section 2.2 and obtain the necessary approvals before proceeding.
5. Once the CVT has been remedied, dealers should submit the claim using the appropriate
claims coding using the Warranty Flat Rate Manual (WFRM) or applicable TSB coding and
release the vehicle.
