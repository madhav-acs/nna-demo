Infiniti Safety Recall
CAMPAIGN BULLETIN
ABS Actuator Recall
Preliminary Retailer Announcement
Reference: ABS
Date: September 11, 2018
Attention: Retailer Principal, Sales, Parts and Service Managers

***** Campaign Summary *****
INFINITI is committed to the safety and security of our clients and their passengers. INFINITI has notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that it will conduct a Voluntary Recall Campaign on ~16,000 specific MY2017 QX60 vehicles to inspect and, if necessary replace the Antilock Braking System (ABS) actuator.
The ABS actuator pump seal may leak brake fluid onto the control electronic circuit board. If this occurs, an ABS warning lamp will illuminate to warn the driver. If the vehicle continues to be operated in this condition, the brake fluid leak may create an electrical short in the actuator circuit, which in rare cases could potentially lead to a thermal incident. If the ABS warning lamp is continually illuminated, INFINITI recommends parking the vehicle outside and contacting INFINITI Roadside Assistance to have the vehicle towed to an authorized INFINITI service department as soon as possible.
Owners of potentially affected vehicles will be notified beginning in October 2018 and asked to bring their vehicle to an authorized INFINITI retailer to have the remedy work completed at no cost for parts or labor.
INFINITI expects to issue an updated retailer notification with remedy instructions and campaign IDs to identify affected vehicles by September 19, 2018.

1. Please wait until INFNITI issues further instructions and identifies affected vehicles in Service Comm and DBS National Service History – Open Campaigns.
2. Retailers should quarantine parts inventory of the following part numbers and return them immediately to their PDC using an I-code.
